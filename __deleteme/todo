# TODO
#
# return to initial leg positions after no movement instead of staying mid-way through motion
# on start of walking, make sure movements are smooth and feet aren't dragging on ground to go to initial offset positions
# change standing to be smooth and to use combo femur/tibia movement instead of just femur
